## Sample: Micro-frontend portal using Angular and Module Federation

This is a sample code demonstrating an Angular micro-frontend portal using Module Federation. The repository contains two folders for two distinct applications: the shell app and a sample feature app. These applications must be installed and run separately.

Once both applications are running concurrently, they seamlessly integrate to form a unified portal. The shell app serves as the main entry point and orchestrates the integration of the feature app, enabling a cohesive and modular architecture.

By leveraging Module Federation, this sample code showcases the ability to share and compose modules across different applications, facilitating efficient development, maintenance, and deployment of micro-frontends within an Angular ecosystem.
